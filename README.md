# analogueClock
This project showcases the development of a fully functional analogue clock implemented using the core technologies of the web: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock features a classic design, displaying hour, minute, and second hands moving in real-time, mirroring the behavior of a traditional analogue clock.

Dynamic UI Updates: JavaScript is utilized to calculate the current time and dynamically update the clock hands' positions. This involves calculating the appropriate rotation degrees for each hand based on the current time and applying these transformations to the clock hands.

Elegant Aesthetics: The clock's visual design is carefully crafted with CSS, featuring a simple yet elegant interface that includes a circular clock face, tick marks for the hours, and a distinct look for each of the clock hands.

HTML: Structured the clock's layout, including the clock face and hands.

CSS: Styled the clock, including positioning, transitions for smooth hand movements.

JavaScript: Implemented the logic to calculate the current time and dynamically update the hand positions in real-time, ensuring the clock accurately reflects the current time down to the second.
